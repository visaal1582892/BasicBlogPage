Design Choices:

1. For responsive design I used flex containers and for providing widths and heights to elements I used relative units.
2. Used media queries to develop it for different types of devices.
3. Used gradient colors for good and dynamic look.
4. Used good single page navigation for easy navigation among different sections in my web page.

Challenge Faced:

1. I gaced the challenges mainly during weights and heights assigning for the elements. Initially I used px units for providing the widths which failed giving responsive design. So I changes all units to percentages.
2. Another main Challenge is faced during media queries which are vey confusing. But Finally I developed a responsive website.
